msgid "Enable Automatic Sharing of Nested Properties"
msgstr ""

msgid "When sharing a ZFS filesystem over NFS, normally any nested filesystems within the shared filesystem will not be shared and, instead, will appear as empty folders. This setting, when enabled, will automatically create shares for any nested filesystems of this filesystem. Note: this only applies to filesystems shared via OMV's shared folders and not those shared with the "sharenfs" ZFS property.

msgid "AutoShare Filesystem Property"
msgstr ""

msgid "ZFS user properties may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the following punctionation: ':','+','.','_'. They must also contain at least one ':' character to distinguish them from native properties."
msgstr ""

msgid "Property to look for on filesystems that, when present, will indicate whether this filesystem and it's children should be included in automatic sharing. If this is left blank, all shared filesystems will have their nested children automatically shared. If it's set, then only filesystems with the property set to true will be automatically shared while filesystems with this set to false will not be shared. This latter behavior is useful when trying to omit a single nested filesystem from being shared when it's parent is autosharing it's children. See <a href='https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19120-01/open.solaris/817-2271/gdrcw/index.html'>ZFS User Properties</a> for more information.
